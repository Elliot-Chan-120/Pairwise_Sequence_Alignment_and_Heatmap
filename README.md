# Pairwise_Sequence_Alignment_and_Heatmap
 Using the Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithms, this program uses two classes to align two sequence of the same biotype (protein, R/DNA). We can obtain the optimal alignment and the score of the two sequences using either the global (NW) or local (SW) algorithms or both simultaneously.
